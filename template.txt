            My name is <b>Walid Siala</b>, and I am currently a final-year student pursuing a degree in Software Engineering. I am reaching out to express my interest in potential internship opportunities within your <b>DevOps/Cloud team</b> at <b>{company_name}</b>. As part of my academic program, I am required to complete an internship starting from <b>February 2025 that lasts 4 - 6 months</b>. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a practical setting and believe that my background aligns well with the innovative work being done at your organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in <b>cloud computing</b> and <b>DevOps methodologies</b>. I have gained hands-on experience with cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, as well as containerization tools like Docker and orchestration technologies such as Kubernetes. For instance, in a recent project, I designed and deployed a highly available AWS architecture using Terraform, integrating Auto Scaling, Load Balancers, and Docker for scalability. I also automated monitoring, logging, and anomaly detection with AWS CloudWatch, Lambda, and SageMaker, while streamlining deployments through CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
