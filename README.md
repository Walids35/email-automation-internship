# Email Automation

This python script was developed with the objective to reach development's directors in companies in order to get an end-of-studies internship.
Within a database of **150 people**, I got **4 people that were interested to hire me as a software engineer intern in Germany/Netherlands**.

## Steps:
- Create an API Key in the Google Cloud Console.
- Customise the template within your CV.
- Create a contacts.csv containing the list of contacts containing rows: ```email, name, company_name```
- Run the script: ```python send_emails.py```
